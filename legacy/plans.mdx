## Overview

We recently introduced **sync v2**, a major overhaul of our platform that includes a redesigned playground and the release of new lipsync models.

sync v2 brings significant improvements to the user experience, performance, and the underlying technology.

To ensure a smooth transition, we've created legacy-compatible plans that will be supported indefinitely. All existing v1 subscriptions have been migrated to a corresponding v2 legacy plan with the same cost and features.

<Note>

While these plans maintain compatibility with existing integrations, they won't have access to new models and features released on sync v2.

To gain full access to current and future platform capabilities we encourage you to upgrade to a new v2 plan. You can learn more about the new plans by visiting our websites [pricing page](https://sync.so/pricing).
