## Getting Started

You can enable and manage all available integrations from the [integrations page](https://sync.so/integrations). Once enabled, you can:

- Test integrations directly in the Generations Playground
- Preview available options (like voices for text-to-speech)
- Generate ready-to-use code snippets via the _View code_ button
- Implement them in your API calls

**API Key Options:**
- Use Sync's internal integration (Usage costs will be reflected in your [usage billing](https://platform.sync.so/billing/usage))
- Use your own API keys (Available on Creator plan or higher)
