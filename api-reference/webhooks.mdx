## why use webhooks

webhooks offer an efficient way to receive real-time updates on your video generation jobs. instead of repeatedly polling for the status updates, webhooks notify you immediately when a job completes or fails.

## integrating webhooks

to utilize webhooks:

1. specify a `webhookUrl` parameter when calling an api endpoints that support it.
2. ensure your webhook endpoint can receive and handle HTTP `POST` requests.

<Note>
  for security purposes, your webhook URL must be configured to accept and process HTTPS `POST`
  requests.
</Note>

when a job finishes (successfully or not), we'll send an HTTP `POST` request to your specified `webhookUrl` with the job details.

### webhook payload

the webhook payload matches the format of the corresponding `GET` request for the job. for example, a webhook for the `POST /generate` endpoint will return data identical to the `GET /generate/{id}` endpoint:

```json
{
  "id": "<string>",
  "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "status": "<string>",
  "model": "<string>",
  "input": [
    {
      "type": "<string>",
      "url": "<string>"
    }
  ],
  "webhookUrl": "<string>",
  "options": {},
  "stream": true,
  "outputUrl": "<string>",
  "error": "<string>"
}
```

by leveraging webhooks, you can streamline your workflow with non-blocking calls, allowing you to focus on other tasks while receiving job completion notifications.
