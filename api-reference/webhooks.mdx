# using webhooks

to use a webhook, specify the `webhookUrl` parameter when using any of our API endpoints that allow it.

once your job completes or fails, a `POST` request will be sent to the `webhookUrl` with the details of the completed job:

<Note>Ensure your webhook URL is open to `POST` requests and properly handles them.</Note>

data will be returned regardless of the status of the job. the data returned will match the format of the corresponding `get` request for the job.

for example, if you use the `POST /generate` endpoint, the webhook will return the same data as the `GET /generate/{id}` endpoint.

```json
  {
    "id": "<string>",
    "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "status": "<string>",
    "model": "<string>",
    "input": [
      {
        "type": "<string>",
        "url": "<string>"
      }
    ],
    "webhookUrl": "<string>",
    "options": {},
    "stream": true,
    "outputUrl": "<string>",
    "error": "<string>"
  }
```

webhooks simplify your workflow by eliminating the need for frequent status inquiries. you can continue other tasks while waiting for a webhook notification.
