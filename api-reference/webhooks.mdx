# why use webhooks

webhooks offer an efficient way to receive real-time updates on your video generation jobs. instead of repeatedly polling for status updates, webhooks notify you immediately when a job completes or fails.

# implementing webhooks

to utilize webhooks:

1. specify a `webhookUrl` parameter when calling api endpoints that support it.
2. ensure your webhook endpoint can receive and handle HTTP `POST` requests.

<note>your webhook url must be configured to accept and process HTTP `POST` requests securely.</note>

when a job finishes (successfully or not), we'll send an HTTP `POST` request to your specified `webhookUrl` with the job details.

# webhook payload

the webhook payload matches the format of the corresponding `GET` request for the job. for example, a webhook for the `POST /generate` endpoint will return data identical to the `GET /generate/{id}` endpoint:

```json
  {
    "id": "<string>",
    "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "status": "<string>",
    "model": "<string>",
    "input": [
      {
        "type": "<string>",
        "url": "<string>"
      }
    ],
    "webhookUrl": "<string>",
    "options": {},
    "stream": true,
    "outputUrl": "<string>",
    "error": "<string>"
  }
```

by leveraging webhooks, you can streamline your workflow and focus on other tasks while waiting for job completion notifications.
