openapi: post /v2/analyze/cost
description: 'Estimate the cost of a generation before submitting it'
---

## Getting Started

This endpoint allows you to estimate cost by accepting identical parameters to the [`POST /v2/generate`](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/post-generate) endpoint. You can use this to preview the generation cost before sending/performing the actual request.

The response will include the estimated frame count and cost for the generation with the provided parameters.
