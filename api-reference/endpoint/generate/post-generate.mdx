## getting started

authenticate and make your first request to the `generate` api.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="make a request from the docs">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="authorize">
        enter your api key in the `x-api-key` field within the `Authorization` section.

        <Frame caption={`enter your x-api-key in the authorization section`}>
          <img src="/images/generate/generate-authorize.png" alt="authorize generate api" />
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="enter params">
        enter the params in the body section:

        <Frame caption={`
          fill out the body with the required parameters.
        `}>
          <img src="/images/generate/generate-body.png" alt="body params for generate api" />
        </Frame>

        **example input:**

        ```json
        {
          "model": "sync-1.7.1-beta",
          "input": [
            {
              "type": "audio",
              "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
            },
            {
              "type": "video",
              "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
            }
          ],
        }
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="send a request">
        click the `Send` button to submit your request. after the submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your job, the current status, and the details to track your job.

        ```json
        {
          "id": "unique_job_id",
          "createdAt": "date_time",
          "status": "PROCESSING",
          "model": "sync-1.7.1-beta",
          "input": [
            {
              "type": "audio",
              "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
            },
            {
              "type": "video",
              "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
            }
          ],
          "webhookUrl": null,
          "options": {},
          "stream": false,
          "outputUrl": null
        }
        ```

        your job's `status` will start as `pending` and move to `processing`. use the returned `id` with the `GET /lipsync/{id}` endpoint to periodically poll for the status of your job. this polling is crucial for knowing when your video is ready.

## what to do next

explore options for monitoring your job's progress and receiving updates.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="polling for completion">
    periodically send requests to `GET /lipsync/{id}` with your job `id`. when the job status changes to `completed`, the response will include a URL to download your synced video.

    learn how to poll for job completion with the [GET /generate](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/get-generate) endpoint.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="using webhooks">
      
    you can also use webhooks to get real-time updates on the status of your job. to do this, set the `webhookUrl` field in the request body to the URL of your webhook.

    to learn more about webhooks, check out how to use the [webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks).
