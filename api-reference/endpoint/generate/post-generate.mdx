          <img src="/images/generate/generate-body.png" alt="Body params for generate API" />
        </Frame>

        **Example Input:**

        ```json
        {
          "model": "sync-1.9.0-beta",
          "input": [
            {
              "type": "audio",
              "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
            },
            {
              "type": "video",
              "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
            }
          ],
        }
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Send a Request">
        Click the `Send` button to submit your request. After the submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your job, the current status, and the details to track your job.

        ```json
        {
          "id": "unique_job_id",
          "createdAt": "date_time",
          "status": "PROCESSING",
          "model": "sync-1.9.0-beta",
          "input": [
            {
              "type": "audio",
              "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
            },
            {
              "type": "video",
              "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
            }
          ],
          "webhookUrl": null,
          "options": {},
          "stream": false,
          "outputUrl": null
        }
        ```

        Your job's `status` will start as `PENDING` and move to `PROCESSING`. Use the returned `id` with the `GET /lipsync/{id}` endpoint to periodically poll for the status of your job. This polling is crucial for knowing when your video is ready.

## What to Do Next

Explore options for monitoring your job's progress and receiving updates.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Polling for Completion">
    Periodically send requests to `GET /lipsync/{id}` with your job `id`. When the job status changes to `COMPLETED`, the response will include a URL to download your synced video.

    Learn how to poll for job completion with the [GET /generate](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/get-generate) endpoint.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Webhooks">
      
    You can also use webhooks to get real-time updates on the status of your job. To do this, set the `webhookUrl` field in the request body to the URL of your webhook.

    To learn more about webhooks, check out how to use the [Webhooks](/api-reference/webhooks).
