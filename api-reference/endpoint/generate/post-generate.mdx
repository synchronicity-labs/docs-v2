# authentication
before you can start using the api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` header that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the [quickstart guide](/api-reference/quickstart#get-your-api-key) to learn how to obtain one.

# make a request from the docs

<Steps>
  <Step title="authorize">
    enter your api key in the `x-api-key` field within the `Authorization` section.

  </Step>
  <Step title="enter params">
    enter the params in the body section:

    <h3>example input</h3>
    ```json
    {
      "model": "sync-1.7.1-beta",
      "input": [
        {
          "type": "audio",
          "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
        },
        {
          "type": "video",
          "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
        }
      ], 
    }
    ```
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="submit">
    click the `Send` button to submit your request. after submission, you will receive a response that includes the `id` of your job, the current status, and details about the submission.

    <h3>understanding the response</h3>
    the initial response provides you with essential details to track your job:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "unique_job_id",
      "createdAt": "date_time",
      "status": "PROCESSING",
      "model": "sync-1.7.1-beta",
      "input": [
        {
          "type": "audio",
          "url": "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
        },
        {
          "type": "video",
          "url": "https://example.com/video.mp4"
        }
      ], 
      "webhookUrl": null,
      "options": {},
      "stream": false,
      "outputUrl": null
    }
    ```

    your job's `status` will start as `pending` and move to `processing`. use the returned `id` with the `GET /lipsync/{id}` endpoint to periodically poll for the status of your job. this polling is crucial for knowing when your video is ready.

    <h3>polling for completion</h3>
    periodically send requests to `GET /lipsync/{id}` with your job `id`. when the job status changes to `completed`, the response will include a URL to download your synced video.

    learn how to poll for job completion with the [get /generate](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/get-generate) endpoint.

    <h3>using webhooks</h3>
    you can also use webhooks to get real-time updates on the status of your job. to do this, set the `webhookUrl` field in the request body to the URL of your webhook.

    to learn more about webhooks, check out the [webhooks guide](/api-reference/webhooks).
