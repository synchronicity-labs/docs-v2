# authentication
before you can start using the api, you need to authenticate your requests. this is done using an `x-api-key` header that links your requests to your account. if you don't have an api key yet, check out the [quickstart guide](/api-reference/quickstart#get-your-api-key) to learn how to obtain one.

# track your generation from the docs
