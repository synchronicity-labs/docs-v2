Integrations allow you to easily extend Sync's platform with more powerful features, such as text-to-speech.

You can find all available integrations and enable them in [the playground](https://sync.so/integrations), where you can also test them, preview voices, and generate code snippets using _View code_.

Make sure to have an API key from the provider to use the integration.

## ElevenLabs

[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) is at the forefront of research in Text-to-Speech, AI Voice Generation, and more.

This integration extends the _generation_ endpoint with ElevenLabs' [text-to-speech](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech) functionality.

To start using it, refer to the [generate endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/post-generate) reference. Ensure the input `type` is set to `text`, and add `elevenlabs` as the `name` of the provider, along with a valid `voiceId`.
