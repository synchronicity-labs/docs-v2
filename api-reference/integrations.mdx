Integrations allow you to easily extend Sync's platform with more powerful features, such as text-to-speech.

You can find all available integrations and enable them in [the integrations page](https://sync.so/integrations). Once enabled, you can test them in the generations playground, preview voices, and generate code snippets using _View code_.

Enabling integration with own API key is only available on the Creator plan or higher. If you don't provide it, our internal integration will be used, and the usage costs will be reflected in your [usage billing](https://platform.sync.so/billing/usage).

## ElevenLabs

[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) is at the forefront of research in Text-to-Speech, AI Voice Generation, and more.

This integration extends the _generation_ endpoint with ElevenLabs' [Text-to-Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech) functionality.

To start using it, refer to the [generate endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/generate/post-generate) reference. Ensure the input `type` is set to `text`, and add `ElevenLabs` as the `name` of the provider, along with a valid `voiceId`.
