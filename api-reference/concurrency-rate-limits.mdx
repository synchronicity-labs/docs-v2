## Rate Limiting

Sync API has a rate limit of 60 requests per minute across all endpoints, on exceeding this limit, you will receive a 429 error.

## Concurrency

Concurrency refers to the number of generations that can be submitted/processed concurrently. Requests to create new generations will fail with a 429 error if the concurrency limit is exceeded.

To check your generations currently in PENDING/PROCESSING state, you can use the [List Generations](/api-reference/generate-api/endpoints/list-generations) endpoint.

Concurrency limits are defined in the subscription plan. Current limits are:

| Plan       | Concurrent Requests |
|------------|-------------------|
| Hobbyist   | 1               |
| Creator    | 3             |
| Growth     | 6             |
| Scale      | 15             |
| Enterprise | Custom        |
