## Personalized Video Messaging

Personalized video messaging involves creating unique video content tailored to individual recipients. This approach leverages customer data to dynamically generate videos, leading to higher engagement, better conversion rates, and a more personal connection compared to generic video messages. It's often used in sales outreach, marketing campaigns, and customer support.

Follow these steps to run the personalized video messaging example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone Github Repository">
    Clone the [sync-examples repository](https://github.com/synchronicity-labs/sync-examples).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/synchronicity-labs/sync-examples.git
    cd sync-examples/personalized-video-messsging/python
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Environment">
    Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure API Keys">
    You will need [Sync_API_KEY](https://sync.so/keys) and [ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/authentication#api-keys) to run the example. Update constants.py file with your own API keys:

    *   `SYNC_API_KEY`: Your API key for Sync Labs
    *   `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY`: Your API key for ElevenLabs (used for voice generation).

    Ensure the file is saved after adding your keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Input Data (Optional)">
    The repository includes a sample input file `example.csv` for quickstart. 
    You can modify it with your own inputs if desired. Each row typically represents one recipient.

    The input file should have the following columns:
    *   `video`: URL of the video to be personalized.
    *   `text`: Text to be personalized in the video.
    *   `segment_start`: start time of the video segment to be personalized.
    *   `segment_end`: end time of the video segment to be personalized.
    *   `output_format`: output format of the video.
    *   `sync_mode`: mode to sync text to video segment if lengths don't match. [options](https://docs.sync.so/api-reference/endpoint/generate/post-generate#body-options-sync-mode)
    *   `voice_id`: elevenlabs voice id to use for the video. If empty, audio from the video will be cloned.
    *   `lipsync_model`: sync.so lipsync model to use for the video. default: `lipsync-2`
    *   `tts_model`: elevenlabs text to speech model. default: `eleven_multilingual_v2`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Videos">
    Execute the Python script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    This command will start the process of generating personalized videos based on the API keys you configured and the data in `example.csv`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Results">
    On completion, the script will save the results to `outputs.csv` within the same directory. This file will contain output urls corresponding to each input.

    That's it! You've now created personalized video messages for your customers.
