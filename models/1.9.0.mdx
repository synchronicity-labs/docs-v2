<Note>**model id:** `lipsync-1.9.0-beta`</Note>

LipSync 1.9.0-beta is our latest model, representing a new class of lipsync technology under active development.

### Strengths

- Highest resolution lipsync outputs
- Most reliable results for a broad range of input videos
- Faster than previous versions, twice as fast as version 1.8.0
- Generates twice the face region compared to previous versions â€” leading to the jaw and cheek regions, to be modified to match the audio
- Significantly fewer color artifacts compared to previous versions

### Limitations

- Weak style preservation: generated mouth movements might not match the unique speaking style of the person
- Generated lip movements can be feeble if the lips in the input video are completely shut
- Generated teeth might not match the actual teeth of the person

### Considerations

- If the generated lip movements are very different in terms of speaking style, consider older model versions
- As a beta release, use with caution in production environments
