<Note>**model id:** `lipsync-1.7.1`</Note>

LipSync 1.7.1 is our current best stable release, offering improvements over the previous version and excelling in different scenarios:

### Strengths

- Optimized for faces that are slightly smaller in the frame or farther from the camera
- Highly consistent color reproduction
- Generates natural lip shapes
- Preserves identity information well

### Limitations

- May produce artifacts near the teeth
- Can result in slightly blurry output if the face is too close to the camera

### Best Use Cases

- Videos or images with faces at a medium distance from the camera
- Projects requiring high color consistency
- Applications where preserving the subject's identity is crucial

### Considerations

- Recommended for most general lip-sync tasks
- May require balancing face size in the frame with output quality
