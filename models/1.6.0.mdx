<Note>**model id:** `lipsync-1.6.0`</Note>

LipSync 1.6.0 is our oldest model in the lip-synchronization series. It is optimized for specific use cases and has some notable characteristics:

### Strengths

- Best performance with close-up facial shots
- Capable of generating teeth in the output

### Limitations

- Teeth generation can sometimes appear unnatural
- Slight identity changes may occur:
  - Tendency to produce reddish lips
  - May result in slightly fairer skin tones
- Temporal inconsistencies:
  - Colors may be inconsistent between frames
  - Can lead to grainy artifacts

### Best Use Cases

- Videos or images with faces close to the camera
- Projects where slight identity changes are acceptable

### Considerations

- Not recommended for projects requiring strict color consistency across frames
- May require additional post-processing to address grainy artifacts
