<Note>**model id:** `lipsync-1.8.0-beta`</Note>

LipSync 1.8.0 is our latest beta model, representing a new class of lipsync technology under active development:

### Strengths

- Produces sharp, high-quality outputs
- Excellent teeth generation and preservation
- Part of a new generation of lipsync models

### Limitations

- Slower processing time compared to previous versions
- May produce color artifacts (occasional green or purple colors within the face in some frames)
- **Beta status**: may have undiscovered issues or inconsistencies

### Best Use Cases

- Projects where output quality is prioritized over processing speed
- Applications requiring highly accurate teeth representation
- Experimental projects willing to work with beta software

### Considerations

- Not recommended for time-sensitive projects due to slower processing
- May require additional post-processing to address potential color artifacts
- As a beta release, it should be used with caution in production environments
