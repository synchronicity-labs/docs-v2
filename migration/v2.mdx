## Overview

We are excited to introduce **sync v2**, a major overhaul of our platform that includes a redesigned playground and the release of the new lipsync model, `lipsync-1.8.0-beta`.

sync v2 brings significant improvements to the user experience, performance, and the underlying technology.

## Key Benefits of sync v2

- **Redesigned Playground**: Enjoy an improved, more intuitive playground that allows you to compare models, fine-tune generation options, and quickly preview API requests, helping you easily replicate the same functionality in your integrations.
- **New `lipsync-1.8.0-beta` model**: Experience enhanced lip synchronization with major improvements to teeth and mouth generation.
- **Unified API**: Streamlined integration through a single, unified API endpoint, simplifying your workflow and future-proofing your applications.

## Migration Steps

### **Access the new Playground**

- **Where to log in**: Navigate to the new playground at [https://sync.so](https://sync.so/login).
- **Automatic migration**: Your account has already been migrated to sync v2, so simply log in with your existing credentials.

### **Playground Migration**

- **New generations**: The old [v1 playground](https://app.synclabs.so) is no longer available for generating new content.
- **Access to old data**: You will still have access to your v1 generations until **December 1st, 2024**, but no new generations will be possible on v1.
- **Get familiar**: Take some time to explore the redesigned [v2 playground](https://sync.so/login) to get comfortable with the new features and layout.

### **API Changes**

- **Unified API**: We have simplified the API structure, moving to a unified endpoint for easier and more consistent integrations.
- **Next steps**: Review the updated [API documentation](https://docs.sync.so/api-reference/endpoint/generate/post-generate) to make the necessary adjustments to your applications.

## Important Dates

- **Now**: You can start using sync.v2 immediately.
- **December 1st, 2024**: This is the last day you can access your v1 generations and v1 API. After this date, the v1 platform will be fully retired.
